The optional-silence phone SIL occupies 10.8% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 98.3% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence SIL occupies 10.5% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 0.8 hours of data, or 0.7 hours if SIL frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences SIL comprise 3.7% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (21,21.1,44)
