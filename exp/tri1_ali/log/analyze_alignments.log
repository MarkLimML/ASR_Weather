The optional-silence phone SIL occupies 10.9% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 98.2% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence SIL occupies 10.3% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 1.9 hours of data, or 1.7 hours if SIL frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences SIL comprise 3.6% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (22,21.6,46)
