The optional-silence phone SIL occupies 10.4% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 98.8% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence SIL occupies 10.0% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 0.5 hours of data, or 0.4 hours if SIL frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences SIL comprise 3.3% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (25,22.7,47)
