The optional-silence phone SIL occupies 9.7% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 98.6% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence SIL occupies 9.3% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 0.5 hours of data, or 0.4 hours if SIL frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences SIL comprise 3.3% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (23,21.4,44)
